# Semantic search through Wikipedia with the Weaviate vector search engine

[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/current/) is an open source vector search engine with build-in vectorization and question answering modules. We imported the complete English language Wikipedia article dataset into a single Weaviate instance to conduct semantic search queries through the Wikipedia articles, besides this, we've made all the graph relations between the articles too. We have made the import scripts, pre-processed articles, and backup available so that you can run the complete setup yourself. 

If you like what you see, a ‚≠ê on the [Weaviate Github repo](https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/stargazers) or joining our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/weaviate/shared_invite/zt-goaoifjr-o8FuVz9b1HLzhlUfyfddhw) is appreciated.
